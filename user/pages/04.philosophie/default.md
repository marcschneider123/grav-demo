* My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be.
* If she can’t find me, she can’t break up with me.
* I was in the pool!
* The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
* It’s not a lie if you believe it.
* I’m disturbed. I’m depressed. I’m inadequate. I got it all!
